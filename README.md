This is a modification of an older version of Fast64 (up to Refresh 13 in Decomp) with JSON export support for use in [METAL Composer PLUS](https://github.com/projectcomet64/metal-composer).

Besides the JSON export, there are no more changes. If you are using Fast64 to import models, it is currently recommended to install the original, [found here](https://bitbucket.org/kurethedead/fast64).

### Original Fast64 Credits
Thanks to anonymous_moose, Cheezepin, Rovert, and especially InTheBeef for testing.

Above all, thanks to Kurethedead for allowing me to modify the source of the program to fit my needs.
Thanks to SuperG64 for providing a test animation, and the rest of the decomp team for their amazing documentation.

# Instructions
### Installation
Unzip and drag the entire folder into your blender addons folder (usually at C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.80\scripts\addons). Note that you must drag the ENTIRE folder, not just the 'fast64_internal' folder. Then in Blender, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-Ons and find/check the 'Fast64 - METAL Composer' plugin. If it does not show up, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Save&Load and make sure 'Auto Run Python Scripts' is enabled.

**IMPORTANT**: You must not have the regular Fast64 enabled at the same time. This will cause problems.

The rest of the README is similar to Fast64's. For more information, go read that README.
